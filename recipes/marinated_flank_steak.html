        <h2>Description</h2>
           <p>Flank steak is a lean cut of beef that comes from the cow's lower abdominal muscles. 
             It's a relatively tough cut that's low in fat,
             which means a few things: Flank steak doesn't need to be trimmed, 
             it's inexpensive compared to other cuts, and it benefits greatly from marination.
           </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>½ cup vegetable oil</li>
            <li>¼ cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoons low-sodium soy sauce</li>
            <li>¼ cup red wine vinegar</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice</li>
            <li>1 ½ tablespoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon Dijon mustard</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 (1 1/2-pound) flank steak</li>
          </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>Whisk together oil, soy sauce, vinegar, lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce, Dijon mustard, garlic, and pepper for marinade in a 9x13-inch glass baking dish until thoroughly combined.</li>
            <li>Add flank steak to the baking dish; turn several times to coat thoroughly with marinade. Cover, and refrigerate for 2 to 6 hours, or up to 12 hours if you have time.</li>
            <li>When ready to cook, preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
            <li>Remove steak from the marinade and shake off excess. Discard the remaining marinade.</li>
            <li>Cook steak on the preheated grill for about 5 minutes per side, or to desired doneness.</li>
            <li>Remove from the grill and let rest for 5 minutes before slicing and serving.</li>
