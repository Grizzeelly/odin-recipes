          <h2>Description</h2>
          <p>
            Pizza is a dish of Italian origin consisting of a usually round, 
            flat base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, 
            cheese, and often various other ingredients, 
            which is then baked at a high temperature, 
            traditionally in a wood-fired oven. 
            A small pizza is sometimes called a pizzetta.
